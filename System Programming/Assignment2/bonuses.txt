BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. the dealer starts all the threads according to their order in the players array (and it waits until the thread actually starts before starting the next one) then when the dealer thread is terminated it iterates over the players array in reverse orders and terminates them by notifying the player and using the join() function to finish the player's run.
2. it's used in the Dealer's run function (to start the threads) and in the Dealer's terminate functions to finish each thread's run.
3. we made sure the players were created and terminated in the correct order in the log files.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
